Academic Maths papers 
Scans Maths paper and look for sums, extract sums as strings
Evaluate sums and spit out the original sum with evaluated results

Build a String calulator
require a space 
raise error "Input must be a valid mathematical string separated by spaces" if no space and can't be any generic
raise error  "divided by zero" if divided by O
ZeroDivisionError

Input | Output (if no issue, ans should return an array and evaluated ans)
"5 / 4" | ["5 / 4", 1.25] = require a space
"5/4" | RAISE A MATHS ERROR 
"4 ] 6" | RAISE MATHEMATICAL ERROR
"5 + 1" | ["5 + 1", 6]
