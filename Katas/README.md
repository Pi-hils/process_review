You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

Given an array
1) Ensure that the number is + <br>
2) If number is positive, push into a new array
3) Add each number within the new array (can increment)
4) Else if number is -, leave it

negative?
positive?
