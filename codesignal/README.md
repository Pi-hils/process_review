Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, 
find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. 
In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence 
has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.
